                        CIK planed to launch a new website with a new name (IVC TEL) which aims to meet

                        should have a very different feeling from CIK Telecom. IVC's personality should be
                        friendly, fresh, and understandable.

                        As a designer who was in a transition time from graphic designer to UI designer, I felt
                        heavy on my shoulder. I do have 4 years experience of graphic work, and finished 2
                        web page redesign project in CIK, but it's my first time to be the only ui/ux designer for building a brand new
                        website. Also, the decision would be more rely on internal (Marketing Department)
                         meetings and discussion rather than
                        research interview and user testing due to limited recourses. Moreover there's only 2 months
                        for me to finish all design process before handing over to IT Department.

                        <p>
                            At the very beginning of this project, we have confirmed that the website will be just
                            about internet plan and maybe 1or 2 related service, so the site structure is flat and
                            straightforward.

                            After an efficient card sorting meeting, the topics from content within the website had
                            been sorted out. Based on that, I made the wireframes to present all the topics we
                            selected. And they were confirmed by the management.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choosing an appropriate color combination in the website design process is considered one of the 
                            most important steps in creating a successful website. To avoid going into a dead-end and also to have more feedback,I came up with 4 different color theme. 
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, none of these get a 100% overwhelming winning.(designer need a strong heart.) My manager suggested me maybe I can try some color close to The flag of Quebec, 
                            since the website targets to QC area. And this color strategy was approved by the most management.

                            We planed to put banner on each page, so it will be the first sight when visitor open the page which means how people feel about the banners will affect how they feel about the page. 
                            The pop art style came to my mind firstly,cuz it contains bright color, exaggerated icons and it's challenging spirit. After creating a pop art style banner, I took some time to crunch the origin 
                            idea of building this website and got some inspiration when I walked my dog" Lemon". And then I created 2nd banner which using 
                            cute puppies. Emotionally, puppy element can bring out a more friendly feeling and create a relax "home" feeling to our website. This version got more support than pop art style.

                        <p>
                            Web page is a mix of color, type, shape, words, paragraphs, etc. in a logical way. And I believe less is more in a visual presenting. 
                            So I made sure all the pages should have the bare minimum content to help people decide where they want to go next. 
                            Also, I used consistent type/color/shape scale and a restrained use of puppy picture create a relax rhythm on each page that helps users focus.

                            <p>Once finished all the web page mock-ups, I need to apply the design style to order placement page.
A progress bar was built in all the order placing and confirmation pages so that the user knows what information s(he) has to fill at each stage. This also breaks down the process into chunks and the user is not burdened with everything on one page.

The visual hierarchy is also displayed based on different content importance. This gives visitors the clarity to understand the actions they need to take to finish the process.

                                The design spec is a must because it communicates designer's language to a developer's language. It creates the opportunity for the developers to visualize and accurately collect the information from designer. 
                                A clear annotation is always better than a guessing.

                            The website was published to public on September 1st, 2019. By the end of December,
                            the average orders we got each day is 11 and we got highest orders which is 135 orders
                            on Boxing Day. Our data specialist told me it's a good performance for a brand new
                            website.

                            Looking back on this project, there's a lot moments are unforgettable. What impressed
                            me the most is not when my design got approved but is when I kept trying to create a
                            better solution for users maybe it's just a button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And somehow I feel pity that we didn't have a chance to do the usability testing so we
                            could have more chance to make it better. I might suggest to have an internal usability
                            testing in the future to improve the website.

                            2019 is a big year for CIK TELECOM. As an ISP who has more than 250000 customers, we are always exploring 
                            new service and product to meet the market’s need. After long-term market analysis，we decided to launch 
                            our Home Security Service to Ontario province first and it gets a good market response. Since more and 
                            more customers expect to control and manage their devices from a mobile platform. Moreover, CIK does need 
                            an app to help users to check service, invoice balance, place tickets, add or delete service etc. which is 
                            available for mobile and tablet.

                                Since simplicity is the core of this app, so I made a clear page for onboarding step. No slide ads take up your time before onboarding. 
                                All you need to do is type in your email address and password. A small decoration tinges the interface with its friendly greeting.

                            <p>The slide ads banner only takes around 25% space of the home page, which as a concession to the main dashboard. Meanwhile, 
                                it still can help our users know the promotion plan and latest service.</p>
                            <p>The main dashboard was positioned in the centre of the page which carry out all functions of this app. Users can enter into a detail function pager after tapping the icon.</p> 
                            <p>Within all functions, checking balance and making payments are the top 2 needs from our existed users based on upfront analysis. So I made a shortcut for these to maximize the convenience.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After pressing the arrow button of “account balance”, users get into the detailed invoice page. 
                                We show invoice cycle by cycle (month by month), so users can easily check which month they missed the payment. 
                                The unpaid months are listed at top of the results with an “unpaid” tag sitting on right corner. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If users want to know more details of the invoice, they can continue digging into it by clicking the arrow button. 
                                In this page, refined invoice details are displayed by listing out the user’s current service. If they still have doubt, they can tap “view PDF” to obtain the  E-Statements.

                                Tapping the “ open tickets” icon in homepage dashboard, users enter into tickets function. They can either open a new ticket or check the tickets records.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once they click “open ticket”, all they need to do is just entering the required information and submit. No redundant design in this page, 
                                because the main purpose is to help user to file the ticket in shortest time.

                                Although the pages here are barely informative, I tried to make it a comfortable and smooth experience by using appropriate colour, font size and space.

                                Tapping “control panel” button on the dashboard, users enter into the security alarm function. Friendly and fresh icons are used in “ Alarm Modes” page. 
                                Users can easily switch to any modes by holding the icon for 2 seconds. The check mark indicates user’s current mode. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If they want to explore more of the mode, they just need to tap the arrow button for next step. All working sensor are displayed under Home Mode page. 
                                By clicking the one they want to check, they can easily check further information of the sensor.

                                1. All elements should make sense in an app. 

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since the screen size is way much smaller than a desktop screen. So all elements should have it’s own task, no matter it’s an icon or a button. 
If it makes no sense and not necessary for the user, why put it on the screen?
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                2. The task path should be clear all the time
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Users can easily click the navigation if they feel they lost in the website. But in an app, there’s no navigation. 
                                So the design has to make sure users can finish their task following the path we pave for them, and also make sure they can get back to the original point easily. 

                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                3. Before we release our app in Apple store and Google play store, we only had the chance to do an internal usability testing in CIK company. 
                                I really hope we can invite our real customers to attend the usability test before we start the redesign.
