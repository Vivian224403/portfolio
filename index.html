                        CIK planed to launch a new website with a new name (IVC TEL) which aims to meet

                        should have a very different feeling from CIK Telecom. IVC's personality should be
                        friendly, fresh, and understandable.

                        As a designer who was in a transition time from graphic designer to UI designer, I felt
                        heavy on my shoulder. I do have 4 years experience of graphic work, and finished 2
                        web page redesign project in CIK, but it's my first time to be the only ui/ux designer for building a brand new
                        website. Also, the decision would be more rely on internal (Marketing Department)
                         meetings and discussion rather than
                        research interview and user testing due to limited recourses. Moreover there's only 2 months
                        for me to finish all design process before handing over to IT Department.

                        <p>
                            At the very beginning of this project, we have confirmed that the website will be just
                            about internet plan and maybe 1or 2 related service, so the site structure is flat and
                            straightforward.

                            After an efficient card sorting meeting, the topics from content within the website had
                            been sorted out. Based on that, I made the wireframes to present all the topics we
                            selected. And they were confirmed by the management.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choosing an appropriate color combination in the website design process is considered one of the 
                            most important steps in creating a successful website. To avoid going into a dead-end and also to have more feedback,I came up with 4 different color theme. 
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, none of these get a 100% overwhelming winning.(designer need a strong heart.) My manager suggested me maybe I can try some color close to The flag of Quebec, 
                            since the website targets to QC area. And this color strategy was approved by the most management.

                            We planed to put banner on each page, so it will be the first sight when visitor open the page which means how people feel about the banners will affect how they feel about the page. 
                            The pop art style came to my mind firstly,cuz it contains bright color, exaggerated icons and it's challenging spirit. After creating a pop art style banner, I took some time to crunch the origin 
                            idea of building this website and got some inspiration when I walked my dog" Lemon". And then I created 2nd banner which using 
                            cute puppies. Emotionally, puppy element can bring out a more friendly feeling and create a relax "home" feeling to our website. This version got more support than pop art style.

                        <p>
                            Web page is a mix of color, type, shape, words, paragraphs, etc. in a logical way. And I believe less is more in a visual presenting. 
                            So I made sure all the pages should have the bare minimum content to help people decide where they want to go next. 
                            Also, I used consistent type/color/shape scale and a restrained use of puppy picture create a relax rhythm on each page that helps users focus.

                            <p>Once finished all the web page mock-ups, I need to apply the design style to order placement page.
A progress bar was built in all the order placing and confirmation pages so that the user knows what information s(he) has to fill at each stage. This also breaks down the process into chunks and the user is not burdened with everything on one page.

The visual hierarchy is also displayed based on different content importance. This gives visitors the clarity to understand the actions they need to take to finish the process.

                                The design spec is a must because it communicates designer's language to a developer's language. It creates the opportunity for the developers to visualize and accurately collect the information from designer. 
                                A clear annotation is always better than a guessing.

                            The website was published to public on September 1st, 2019. By the end of December,
                            the average orders we got each day is 11 and we got highest orders which is 135 orders
                            on Boxing Day. Our data specialist told me it's a good performance for a brand new
                            website.

                            Looking back on this project, there's a lot moments are unforgettable. What impressed
                            me the most is not when my design got approved but is when I kept trying to create a
                            better solution for users maybe it's just a button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And somehow I feel pity that we didn't have a chance to do the usability testing so we
                            could have more chance to make it better. I might suggest to have an internal usability
                            testing in the future to improve the website.

                            CIK planed to launch a new website with a new name (IVC TEL) which aims to meet
                            different serving needs and to consolidate market position in QC. The new website
                            should have a very different feeling from CIK Telecom. IVC's personality should be
                            friendly, fresh, and understandable.

                            And somehow I feel pity that we didn't have a chance to do the usability testing so we
                            could have more chance to make it better. I might suggest to have an internal usability
                            testing in the future to improve the website.
